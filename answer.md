Answer 1 -> The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is many-to-one, meaning that multiple products can belong to the same product category, but each product can belong to only one category. This is reflected in the "category_id" foreign key in the "Product" table, which references the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" table.
Answer 2 -> To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, we enforce referential integrity by setting up a foreign key constraint. In the "Product" table, the "category_id" column would be defined as a foreign key referencing the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This ensures that any value entered into the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must match a valid "id" in the "Product_Category" table.
